# Modelling-and-simulation-of-hovercraft
I have done modelling the equations of motions of hovercraft and I implement it into Simulink model then I have designed a Fuzzy PID controller and PID controller then I implement  it , finally I have done a comparison between two model to compare the performance of each one
the file optm.fis is rule of Fuzzy PID controller 
the file untitled_parameters.m is main parameters at the model
